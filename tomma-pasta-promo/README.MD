# 🍝 Tomma Pasta Sauce Promo Email

A clean, responsive promotional email for a food brand. I built this project to show I can code static HTML emails using a classic Z-pattern layout that looks great and works perfectly in any inbox.

## 🛠️ What I Did
* **Verified HTML Code & Functionality:** Built with MJML and verified the final HTML to ensure bulletproof functionality and rendering across tough email clients like Microsoft Outlook.
* **Accessibility:** Added hidden preview text, `lang="en"`, descriptive `alt` text, and `role="presentation"` tags so the email is fully accessible for screen readers.
* **Code Readability:** Left clear, simple structural comments inside the HTML so any developer looking at my code knows exactly where each section starts and ends.

## 📁 Files inside
* `tomma-pasta-promo1.mjml` — The layout code.
* `tomma-pasta-promo1.html` — The final, commented HTML code ready to be sent.
