# 🎧 Linx Systems Promo Email

A simple promotional email for a headphone brand. I built this project to show I can code clean, static HTML emails that look great and work perfectly in any inbox.

## 🛠️ What I Did
* **Built with MJML:** Used MJML to make sure the email stacks perfectly on mobile and doesn't break in tough email clients like Microsoft Outlook.
* **Made it Accessible:** Added all the right tags (`lang="en"`, descriptive `alt` text, and `role="presentation"`) so screen readers can easily read it.
* **Cleaned Up the Code:** I left clear, simple comments inside the HTML so anyone looking at my code knows exactly where each section starts and ends.

## 📁 Files inside
* `linx-promo1.mjml` — The layout code.
* `linx-promo1.html` — The final, commented HTML code ready to be sent.
